# 🚀 The Antigravity Developer Stack (AGDS)

> **"Magic is not in the recipe, it is in the cook. But a good recipe helps."**

Welcome to my personal collection of **Super-Skills** for the AI-Augmented Developer. This repository is not just a library of prompts; it is a battle-tested **Second Brain** designed to operationalize high-level engineering patterns, architectural decisions, and autonomous agent protocols.
