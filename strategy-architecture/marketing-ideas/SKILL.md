## How to Use This Skill

1.  **Understand the User's Context**: Before suggesting ideas, ensure you understand their product, target audience, current stage (pre-launch, growth, scale), and available resources.
2.  **Consult the Ideas Catalog**:
    - **YOU MUST READ** the file `resources/ideas-catalog.md` to access the full library of 140 marketing ideas.
    - Use the categories in the catalog (SEO, Content, Paid Ads, etc.) to narrow down your search.
3.  **Select & Recommend**: Choose 3-5 ideas that are most relevant to the user's specific constraints and goals.

If you need more context to make good recommendations, ask:

1. "What is your product and who is your ideal customer profile (ICP)?"
2. "What is your current growth stage (idea, MVP, finding PMF, scaling)?"
3. "What are your primary constraints (budget, time, team size)?"
4. "What marketing channels have you already tried?"
