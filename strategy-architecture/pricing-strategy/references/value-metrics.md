# Value Metrics

## What is a Value Metric?

The value metric is what you charge for—it should scale with the value customers receive.

**Good value metrics:**

- Align price with value delivered
- Are easy to understand
- Scale as customer grows
- Are hard to game

## Common Value Metrics

| Metric             | Best For               | Example             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Per user/seat      | Collaboration tools    | Slack, Notion       |
| Per usage          | Variable consumption   | AWS, Twilio         |
| Per feature        | Modular products       | HubSpot add-ons     |
| Per contact/record | CRM, email tools       | Mailchimp, HubSpot  |
| Per transaction    | Payments, marketplaces | Stripe, Shopify     |
| Flat fee           | Simple products        | Basecamp            |
| Revenue share      | High-value outcomes    | Affiliate platforms |

## Choosing Your Value Metric

**Step 1: Identify how customers get value**

- What outcome do they care about?
- What do they measure success by?
- What would they pay more for?

**Step 2: Map usage to value**

| Usage Pattern            | Value Delivered          | Potential Metric |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| More team members use it | More collaboration value | Per user         |
| More data processed      | More insights            | Per record/event |
| More revenue generated   | Direct ROI               | Revenue share    |
| More projects managed    | More organization        | Per project      |

**Step 3: Test for alignment**

Ask: "As a customer uses more of [metric], do they get more value?"

- If yes → good value metric
- If no → price doesn't align with value

## Mapping Usage to Value: Framework

**1. Instrument usage data**
Track how customers use your product:

- Feature usage frequency
- Volume metrics (users, records, API calls)
- Outcome metrics (revenue generated, time saved)

**2. Correlate with customer success**

- Which usage patterns predict retention?
- Which usage patterns predict expansion?
- Which customers pay the most, and why?

**3. Identify value thresholds**

- At what usage level do customers "get it"?
- At what usage level do they expand?
- At what usage level should price increase?

**Example Analysis:**

```
Usage-Value Correlation Analysis:
─────────────────────────────────
Segment: High-LTV customers (>$10k ARR)
Average monthly active users: 15
Average projects: 8
Average integrations: 4

Segment: Churned customers
Average monthly active users: 3
Average projects: 2
Average integrations: 0

Insight: Value correlates with team adoption (users)
        and depth of use (integrations)

Recommendation: Price per user, gate integrations to higher tiers
```
