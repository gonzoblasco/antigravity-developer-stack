# Monetization Tactics

## Freemium vs. Free Trial

### When to Use Freemium

**Freemium works when:**

- Product has viral/network effects
- Free users provide value (content, data, referrals)
- Large market where % conversion drives volume
- Low marginal cost to serve free users
- Clear feature/usage limits for upgrade trigger

**Freemium risks:**

- Free users may never convert
- Devalues product perception
- Support costs for non-paying users
- Harder to raise prices later

**Example: Slack**

- Free tier for small teams
- Message history limit creates upgrade trigger
- Free users invite others (viral growth)
- Converts when team hits limit

### When to Use Free Trial

**Free trial works when:**

- Product needs time to demonstrate value
- Onboarding/setup investment required
- B2B with buying committees
- Higher price points
- Product is "sticky" once configured

**Trial best practices:**

- 7-14 days for simple products
- 14-30 days for complex products
- Full access (not feature-limited)
- Clear countdown and reminders
- Credit card optional vs. required trade-off

**Credit card upfront:**

- Higher trial-to-paid conversion (40-50% vs. 15-25%)
- Lower trial volume
- Better qualified leads

### Hybrid Approaches

**Freemium + Trial:**

- Free tier with limited features
- Trial of premium features
- Example: Zoom (free 40-min, trial of Pro)

**Reverse trial:**

- Start with full access
- After trial, downgrade to free tier
- Example: See premium value, live with limitations until ready

## When to Raise Prices

### Signs It's Time

**Market signals:**

- Competitors have raised prices
- You're significantly cheaper than alternatives
- Prospects don't flinch at price
- "It's so cheap!" feedback

**Business signals:**

- Very high conversion rates (>40%)
- Very low churn (<3% monthly)
- Customers using more than they pay for
- Unit economics are strong

**Product signals:**

- You've added significant value since last pricing
- Product is more mature/stable
- New features justify higher price

### Price Increase Strategies

**1. Grandfather existing customers**

- New price for new customers only
- Existing customers keep old price
- Pro: No churn risk
- Con: Leaves money on table, creates complexity

**2. Delayed increase for existing**

- Announce increase 3-6 months out
- Give time to lock in old price (annual)
- Pro: Fair, drives annual conversions
- Con: Some churn, requires communication

**3. Increase tied to value**

- Raise price but add features
- "New Pro tier with X, Y, Z"
- Pro: Justified increase
- Con: Requires actual new value

**4. Plan restructure**

- Change plans entirely
- Existing customers mapped to nearest fit
- Pro: Clean slate
- Con: Disruptive, requires careful mapping

### Communicating Price Increases

**For new customers:**

- Just update pricing page
- No announcement needed
- Monitor conversion rate

**For existing customers:**

```

## Pricing Page Best Practices

### Above the Fold

- Monthly/annual toggle
- Primary CTA for each tier

### Tier Presentation

- Lead with the recommended tier (visual emphasis)
- Show value progression clearly

### Common Elements

- [ ] Feature comparison table
- [ ] Who each tier is for
- [ ] FAQ section
- [ ] Contact sales option

### Pricing Psychology to Apply

- **Round pricing:** $50 vs. $49 (for premium)
- **Annual savings:** Show monthly price but offer annual discount (17-20%)
