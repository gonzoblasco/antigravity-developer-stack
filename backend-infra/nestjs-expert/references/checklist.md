# NestJS Code Review Checklist

### Module Architecture & Dependency Injection

- [ ] All services are properly decorated with @Injectable()
- [ ] Providers are listed in module's providers array and exports when needed
- [ ] No circular dependencies between modules (check for forwardRef usage)
- [ ] Module boundaries follow domain/feature separation
- [ ] Custom providers use proper injection tokens (avoid string tokens)

### Testing & Mocking

- [ ] Test modules use minimal, focused provider mocks
- [ ] TypeORM repositories use getRepositoryToken(Entity) for mocking
- [ ] No actual database dependencies in unit tests
- [ ] All async operations are properly awaited in tests
- [ ] JwtService and external dependencies are mocked appropriately

### Database Integration (TypeORM Focus)

- [ ] Entity decorators use correct syntax (@Column() not @Column('description'))
- [ ] Connection errors don't crash the entire application
- [ ] Multiple database connections use named connections
- [ ] Database connections have proper error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Entities are properly registered in TypeOrmModule.forFeature()

### Authentication & Security (JWT + Passport)

- [ ] JWT Strategy imports from 'passport-jwt' not 'passport-local'
- [ ] JwtModule secret matches JwtStrategy secretOrKey exactly
- [ ] Authorization headers follow 'Bearer [token]' format
- [ ] Token expiration times are appropriate for use case
- [ ] JWT_SECRET environment variable is properly configured

### Request Lifecycle & Middleware

- [ ] Middleware execution order follows: Middleware → Guards → Interceptors → Pipes
- [ ] Guards properly protect routes and return boolean/throw exceptions
- [ ] Interceptors handle async operations correctly
- [ ] Exception filters catch and transform errors appropriately
- [ ] Pipes validate DTOs with class-validator decorators

### Performance & Optimization

- [ ] Caching is implemented for expensive operations
- [ ] Database queries avoid N+1 problems (use DataLoader pattern)
- [ ] Connection pooling is configured for database connections
- [ ] Memory leaks are prevented (clean up event listeners)
- [ ] Compression middleware is enabled for production
